# AFame Technologies Data Science Internship Project

Welcome to the repository for the Data Science internship project at AFame Technologies! In this project, we aim to predict the rating of a movie based on various features such as genre, director, and actors. Below you will find an overview of the project, its objectives, and how to navigate through the repository.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict the rating of a movie using machine learning techniques. The features considered for prediction include:
- Genre of the movie
- Director of the movie
- Actors starring in the movie

These features are known to influence the audience's perception of a movie and hence are crucial in predicting its rating.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
|- data/                   # Directory for dataset files
   |- movies.csv           # Dataset containing movie information
|- notebooks/              # Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model development
   |- rating_prediction_model.pkl   # Trained model for rating prediction
|- README.md               # Repository overview and guide
```

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/afame-internship-project.git
   cd afame-internship-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore the Notebooks:**
   - `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Clean and preprocess the dataset.
   - `Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb`: Explore data insights to understand relationships between features and ratings.
   - `Model_Training.ipynb`: Train machine learning models to predict movie ratings.

4. **Run the Notebooks:**
   Open Jupyter Notebook and run each notebook in the `notebooks/` directory sequentially.

5. **View the Model:**
   Once trained, the model will be saved as `rating_prediction_model.pkl` in the `models/` directory.

## Conclusion

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to the Data Science internship project at AFame Technologies, focusing on predicting movie ratings based on key features. Feel free to explore, learn, and extend the project further as per your interest and learning objectives.
